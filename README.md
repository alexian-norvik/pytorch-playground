PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library widely used for:
* Deep learning research and production.
* High flexibility due to its dynamic computation graph
* Strong GPU acceleration support
* A growing ecosystem, including `torchvision` for image processing and `torchtext` for NLP.

Pytorch is preferred over other libraries such as TensorFlow for its ease to use, Pythonic design, and better debugging capabilities.

### Introduction to Tensors
A Tensor is multidimensional array, similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for GPUs.
